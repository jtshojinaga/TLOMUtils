## About the Bot
TLOM Utility (TLOMUtils) is a Discord bot designed to provide members with a more realistic, chance-based system for making their characters including coat mutations like albinism and health conditions. This creates a more immersive roleplay experience and keeps the in-game ecosystem balanced. 

# Features
- Application commands: TLOMUtils uses Discord's built-in app commands (also called "slash commands) through discord.py's library to create a seamless user experience
- Adjustable rates: TLOMUtils has a modular design, so at any time the incidence rates of mutations can be adjusted
- More planned!

## Commands
- `/rollmutations`: Rolls a random mutation for either albinism, melanism, piebaldism, leucism, or all four at once. Requires users to select a species to ensure that species can have coat mutations.
- `/rollconditions`: Rolls a random health condition, ranging from milder conditions like colorblindness to severe conditions like a weak immune system.
- `/rollillness`: Rolls a random acute illness for players to roleplay being sick from wounds, rotten meat, etc. (Planned)
